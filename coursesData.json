Wouldn't it be great if you could use your web development knowledge, combined with your React knowledge, to build mobile apps with that? That's exactly what React Native allows you to do! No need to learn Java, Android, Swift, ObjectiveC or anything of that - React and JavaScript is all you need to create awesome native mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS. That's probably the reason why Instagram, AirBnB, Skype and many other global companies are using it to build their mobile apps! With this course, you can join this league. I'll teach you all you need to create your own React Native apps, publish them to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store and dive really deep into the React Native ecosystem. You'll learn all about the theory behind React Native, its core concepts, how to build responsive designs that work on different device sizes, how to navigate around, use maps and the camera and so much more! And which better way to learn than by building a real app? We'll build the 'Favorite Places' app in this course, an app where users can share amazing pictures and the location where they took them. This app will allow you to see things like using maps, the camera, user authentication, connecting to a server and much more in action.By the end of the course, we'll of course also go through all steps required to get it into an app store."

One of the most common reason executives are derailed is because they don’t have people/communication skills. Because 93% of interpersonal communication is NON-verbal, this course will help you learn to use non-verbals to create the best first impression, which includes showing confidence, dressing appropriately, giving a strong handshake, good eye contact, asking questions and thoughtfully listening to what they say. You'll also learn to shine in job interviews, to become more likable, to give engaging presentations, by paying attention to your voice, posture, gestures, and facial expressions. And you’ll become better in reading body language, so you can be more empathetic to co-workers, employees, and your boss. What does it mean when someone crosses their arms, when they purse their lips, when they have arms akimbo? How does body language establish territoriality in the office? In what ways can you become less defensive, which pushes people away, and more open, which welcomes others and creates collegiality. The course has 11 lectures, quizzes and exercises to help you learn the material. It is recommended you take the course with the study group at work and share your insights, practice new skills, and give each other feedback."
